About tests (for AFPy contributors only)
========================================

Test are run with the real afpy's ldap server since it's hard to mock a ldap server.

To run tests create a tunnel::

  $ ssh -L 1389:localhost:389 py.afpy.org

Then run tests::

  $ python bootstrap.py
  $ ./bin/buildout
  $ ./bin/nosetest
